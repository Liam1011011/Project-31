# Project-31
This project creates a temperature monitoring display with the use of an Adafruit ST7789 240x320 2" TFT Display, a TMP36 temperature sensor, and an Arduino board. When the program is run it will print y axis and x axis lines, as well as temperature reference values on the y axis every 5 degrees celcius from 50 to 0 degrees. The program will take an initial temperature reading. Thereafter, the program reads a value from the sensor once every 20 minutes and prints it as a pixel on the screen. The pixel ranges in y for temperature and in x for when it was taken (the second reading will have a higher x value than the first, and so on). It will also display the last taken temperature value at the top of the screen (e.g., "current: 18° C").
